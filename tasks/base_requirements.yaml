name: requirements
objective: "Gather and clarify all requirements for the coding task"
description: "Collect functional requirements, constraints, input/output specifications, and understand success criteria"
substeps:
  - "Identify functional requirements"
  - "Identify constraints and edge cases"
  - "Clarify input/output specifications"
